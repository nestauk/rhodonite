============
Installation
============

Rhodonite requires Python 3.5 or higher.

Install the current release of Rhodonite from the command line with::

    pip install rhodonite

Dependencies
------------

Large parts of Rhodonite rely on the Python package, ``graph-tool``. This allows 
graphs to be created and manipulated quickly and efficiently. More information 
can be found in the `graph-tool website and documentation`__.

If you are using an environment manager such as ``conda`` or ``virtualenv``, we 
recommend installing ``graph-tool`` using Docker.
