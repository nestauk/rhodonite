Introduction to Rhodonite
=========================

Congratulations on finding your way to the Rhodonite documentation.

Rhodonite is a Python library that implements network science algorithms 
to create, manipulate and study cooccurrence networks and communities.


Some examples of what Rhodonite allows you to do:

-  easily create and enrich cooccurrence graphs from data
-  study the evolution of cooccurrence graphs over time
-  create temporal graphs of community evolution, such as phylomemies 
-  convert graphs to tabular data structures for analysis

Who is Rhodonite for?
---------------------

The methods available in Rhodonite are largely inspired by works from the field 
of science and research studies, and are therefore primarily aimed at helping 
to perform this kind of work. However many of the algorithms have more general 
applications.

Why "Rhodonite"?
----------------

Complete graphs are a type of network where each node is connected to all other 
nodes. The shape that is created by drawing such an arrangement, with all nodes 
spaced equally along the circumference of a circle, is sometimes called a mystic 
rose. *Rhodo*, derived from Ancient Greek, is a prefix used to mean rose or rosy, 
and rhodonite is a pink mineral with a highly crystalline lattice.
